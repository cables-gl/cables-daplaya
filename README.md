# cables daplaya

a simple offline player for [cables](https://cables.gl) patches using the electron framework.

can be used on different platforms (win, osx, linux) to use cables patches offline after importing them through daplaya.

# OSX NOTES!!!
apple introduced some security features that make it next to impossible to build these kind of apps at the moment, so
there is a few caveats when using this on OS X
* the executable is not signed, you will need to whitelist it on every machine you run it on (right click, "open" usually does that)
  * we cannot sign this executable, as it's contents do change when downloading a patch, this is intended...sorry...
  * there is no build for arm/m1-architecture, apple forbids running unsigned apps that are build for arm entirely, not even whitelisting is possible...
* once you downloaded the app, USE THE FINDER to move it basically anywhere else (like your desktop) before opening it
  * apple puts downloaded apps into a random read-only directory UNTIL YOU MOVE IT USING FINDER, we need to write to the directory...sorry...

## features:
* import your patches by using patchid and apikey
* copy whole directory to usb stick and run from there
* cables integrations should work as expected (i.e. midi-ops)
* runs on windows, osx and linux (all 64 bit architecture)
* might be useful to circumvent browser restrictions for external inputs

## usage
* download the appropriate zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables-daplaya/releases)
* create an apikey in [cables](https://cables.gl/settings) (apikeys) (try to use one per instance)
* find the patch you want to export and copy the id from the URL (or the whole url, who cares...)
* extract the zipfile somewhere on your computer (i.e. an usb stick)
* start daplaya (win: daplaya.exe, osx: daplaya.app, linux: ./daplaya)
* you will see a default patch with a cables logo
* press `ctrl-n` to enter apikey and patchid, wait for export
* press `escape` for fullscreen

## keyboard commands (also availabe via menu)
* `alt` to toggle the menu
* `esc` to toggle fullscreen
* `ctrl-n` to import a new patch
* `ctrl-r` to synchronize the patch with the version in the cables editor (reimport)
* `ctrl-o` open filebrowser to open patches that you have exported manually from cables

# development 

## building
* building requires you have run `./update_electron.sh <version>` before
* `npm run clean`to clean up nodemodules and preimported patches and settings
* `npm run build:linux` build linux app in build/linux-x64
* `npm run build:win` build linux app in build/win32-x64
* `npm run build:osx` build linux app in build/darwin-x64

## releases
* releases will try to update electron and build all three platforms as well as the corresponding zipfiles
* this is usually done by github actions
* `npm run package`

## dev
* for development, check out this repository, run `npm run build:<yourplatform>` then `npm run start:<yourplatform>
* no code "hotswap" (yet)
